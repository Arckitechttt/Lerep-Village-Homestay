## **Description**
Created a website to markets and provides informations (facilitations) on the Homestays of Lerep Village. This project takes place from July to August 2023 during the Kuliah Kerja Nyata (KKN) program. The website was designed responsively so it is neatly displayed on many devices (Monitor, Laptop (Small to Large), Tablet / Ipad. Mobile Phone (Small to Large)) using CSS, JavaScript, and HTML5. Each piece of homestay information data was stored and managed in Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage.
